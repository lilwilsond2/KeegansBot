# KeegansBot
MHW bot that Keegan wanted

!hunt (monster) gives you a monsters weaknesses and the tribal style image of the monster

!armor (skill) returns all armor pieces that give that skill (including set bonuses)

All the data for this project from [a great repo](https://github.com/gatheringhallstudios/MHWorldData) from [CarlosFdez](https://github.com/CarlosFdez) and we are currently are pulling from [an api](mhw-db.com) from [LartTyler](https://github.com/LartTyler) that is pretty nifty as well
